		<h3>Assignment 4.1</h3>
		1. What happens when you add a for loop/while loop/switch case block inside a function and use return instead of break?Do statements after the loop run? 
		<br/>2. What is the return value? Can we pass a return value from within a loop? 
		<br/>3. Can you return from inside an if block? What impact does that have?

		<h5>Answers</h5>
		<br/>	<br/>	
		1. If we use return instead of break, return statement not only breaks the loop but also returns from the function without executing remaining lines of code present out of the loop
		<br/><br/>
		2. The return value is the result we pass from the function to main code. By default empty return statement return undefined.
		We cannot return a value directly from the loop as it will return from the function as well, and irrespective of the conditions the iteration will run only once upto return statement.
		But we can use return in loop with if else conditions to return out of the function upon encountering a special condtition..
		<br/><br/>
		3. Yes we can return value from if block present within a function. It exits the function immediately.
