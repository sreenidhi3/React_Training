		<h3>Assignment 3.5</h3>
		Can you use return instead of break in loops?

		<br/>	<br/>	
		Yes we can if the loop is inside a function. 
		<br/>	Also, if return is used instead of break, return statement will not only break the loop but will also return from the function without executing remaining lines of code present out of the loop
